Overview: A description of your solution and approach.
Approach is to use python modules for data visualisation and use FastApi to set up our backend and API services

Then for the simple frontend we use a react-like framework (maybe mithril js) and include 2 buttons (one to print all data, one to select type of data to print).

Unit tests can be written once a minimum viable product is achieved
